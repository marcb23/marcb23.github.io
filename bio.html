	<h1>Marc Bucchieri - About Me</h1>
	<div>
		<h2>Early Life and Education</h2>

		<h2>Short Bio</h2>
		<p>
			I am currently a mechanical engineering student at Tufts University, expected to graduate in June 2016. I enjoy and have experience working on projects that require a broad range of skills, from computer science to electrical engineering to 3D design and printing. My goal as an undergraduate is to acquire internships that allow me to further develop my knowledge of computer programming and mechanical engineering techniques, especially where this involves learning to work with software or technology that is new to me.
		</p>

		<p>
			Apart from engineering background, I have a passion for anything sound- or music-related, and have a solid background in music theory and performance (jazz and classical piano). I also have somewhat extensive experience in education applied to a variety of fields, mostly within the age group of second to eighth grade students. I thoroughly enjoy teaching, be it engineering, music or outdoor skills, and I believe that teaching helps me constantly reinforce my own knowledge of the subject at hand.
